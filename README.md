# Exploring RAG Techniques and Tools

In this project, I will share some of my google colab notebooks that I have used to explore tools and techniques around Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). I mostly utilize Llama Index, together with open-source language models available on Hugging Face. So I recommend you have your Hugging Face account set up before dig into my notebooks here.
